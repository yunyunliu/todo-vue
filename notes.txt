single file components = html template, script, and css together in a single file
parts of vue component:
1. template = markup structure and display logic of component
2. script = non-display logic; exports a js object - this object is where you locally
register components, define inputs/props, define methods, handle local state
3. style = css for the component that can be scoped to styles for the current component

data object/data() method is for storing state

component object exported by <script> section contains properties:
  - name: name of component
  - components: object where you register (child) components to make them available inside
  current component
  - props: for registering component's props/input; either an array of prop names or object containing keys
  for each prop where you can set a default value for the prop, mark it as required, set what type it should
  be (like react propTypes)
  - methods: object containing any methods that need to be called in the component
  - computed:

vue direction = prefixed html attribute 'that tells the library to do sommething to a dom element'

built-in directives:
v-bind: use the bind JS expressions to html elements and components/basically the vue way of
embedding js in html, like how react uses jsx, which is html with javascript between {}
  - shorthand syntax = :attribute="expression"
  v-for: for rendering list of components from an array (like array.map() in react); is like a js for-in loop
  and is attached to the component you want to repeat
v-on: for event-handling/attaching event handler to an element
  - shorthand syntax = @event.modifier="method"
v-model: used to keep a prop in sync with value of <input> element; like using onChange handler that set event.target.value
to state in react
  - syntax = v-model.modifier="variable"

custom events: use to pass data from child to paraent component; a child component can emit a custom event which passes
data with the event to a parent with a listener for the event (like lifting up state in react?)

styling vue component:
1. import external css file into main.js (index.js in react)
2. global css styles in single file component (in <style> element)
3. component-scoped css styles in single file component (using scoped attribute on <style> element)
